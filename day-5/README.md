##Redux Saga Practice

### Objectives

In this case we need to go a bit further and close with the cycle of Flux / Redux calling the server.

### Motivation

We need to give a clean solution to asynchronic calls to a server, and we found a nice library called Redux - Saga that works with effects exposing an API that will help us in our quest.

### What is the application about?

Hot or cold application. This application is a server side with a number that we need to guess :).

But in this case we need to implement the generation of new numbers in order to keep on playing!

### What we are?
